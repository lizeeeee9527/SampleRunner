1. create a changeable input system

3. more windows styles

but for now, it's enough... Maybe its the unltimate version...‚ò∫Ô∏è

## ‚úâÔ∏è Other talk

I'm new to nvim and there're many things I cnanot solve, so I admit that it is almost produced by ai.

But this plugins are quite simple and work well for myself, or maybe for you, so it's a nice try, I think.
