  config = function()
    require("SampleRunner").setup()
  end,
}
```

## 🚀 Usage

1. create a changeable input system
2. more language
3. more windows styles

but for now, it's enough... Maybe its the ultimate version...☺️

## ✉️ Other talk

I'm new to nvim and there're many things I cnanot solve, so I admit that it is almost produced by ai.

But this plugins are quite simple and work well for myself, or maybe for you, so it's a nice try, I think.
